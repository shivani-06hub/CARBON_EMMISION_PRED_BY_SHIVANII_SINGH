# CARBON_EMMISION_PRED_BY_SHIVANII_SINGH

**Data Cleaning & Preparation:**
**Introduction**  
  Summarized the project goal—predicting CO₂ emissions—and provided background on the data source and its relevance.

 **Notebook Setup**  
   Imported essential libraries and loaded the dataset, setting the foundation for further processing.

**Global Data Overview**  
  Performed a high-level scan of the dataset to understand its dimensions, features, and potential issues like inconsistencies or missing entries.

**Initial Project Goals**  
  Defined clear objectives for this stage: clean the data, transform it into a usable format, and prepare it for modeling.

**Data Cleaning Tasks**  
  - **Missing Values**: Identified and addressed null values to ensure model reliability.  
  - **Data Type Conversion**: Transformed columns into numerical types for ML compatibility.  
  - **Feature Renaming**: Renamed columns for clarity and uniformity.  
  - **Removing Empty Rows/Columns**: Dropped irrelevant or uninformative data to improve dataset quality.

**Data Frame Transformation**  
  - **Melting Variables**: Reshaped wide-format data into a long-format using `pd.melt()` for easier integration.  
  - **Merging Datasets**: Integrated multiple variables into a unified format suitable for analysis.

**Advanced Missing Value Handling**  
  - Re-evaluated null values post-transformation.  
  - Filtered rows and columns strategically to retain maximum data while ensuring completeness.

**Final Output**  
  Exported the clean and transformed dataset to a file, making it ready for the next stage: visualization and modeling.


**Data exploration and visualization:**
**Just Started the next step :**

Went beyond the initial task by conducting Data Exploration And Visualization to gain first data insights from descriptive statistics, visualize relevant dependencies and identify global trends. 
This is especially necessary for the proper choice of relevant/important features and of suitable machine learning algorithms for the predictive analysis.
