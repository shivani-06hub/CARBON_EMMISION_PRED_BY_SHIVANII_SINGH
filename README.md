# Data exploration and visualization:

### **1. Environment Setup**
Prepare your coding environment by importing essential libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

### **2. Data Loading**
Bring in the dataset either by uploading a local file or accessing it via an online source.

### **3. Initial Data Inspection**
Use descriptive methods to understand the structure of your data—check column names, data types, shape, missing values, and basic statistics.

### **4. Data Cleaning**
Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and fix outliers or inconsistent entries to ensure data quality.

### **5. Data Visualization**
Plot distributions, correlations, and key metrics using histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps to spot trends and patterns.

### **7. Exploratory Analysis**
Ask analytical questions like:
- Who are the top emitters?
- How does CO₂ relate to factors like population or GDP?
- Are emissions increasing over time?
